# Signing up for Github

For the general public, there is a wikihow that I havenâ€™t tested at: [https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub)

Because you are a student, however, you can apply for the Github for Students account - here is a how-to for that: [https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-for-a-student-developer-pack](https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-for-a-student-developer-pack)

There are benefits in the student developer pack - see: [https://education.github.com/pack\#offers](https://education.github.com/pack#offers) \(including unlimited private repositories\)
